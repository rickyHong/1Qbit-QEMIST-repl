class ParametricQuantumSolver(abc.ABC):
    """Performs energy estimations for a molecule with a parametric circuit.

    Performs energy estimations for a given molecule and a choice of ansatz
    circuit that is supported by the hardware. A concrete class will contain a
    nested Enum class that exposes the supported ansatze to the users. The state
    of the class is created in the costructor so that the `simulate` function
    can just accept an amplitude array and return an energy.

    Attributes:
        amplitude_dimension (int): The size of the amplitudes list that should
            be provided to the solver.
        initial_wavefunction (numpy.array): The initial wavefuntion for the
            simulations.
        n_qubits (int): The number of qubits in the circuit.

        This is intended to be called after the simulation loop of the calling
        code has converged to be passed on to problem decompositions.  In a
        concrete implementation, the `simulate` function would set the necessary
        internal state for the class so that this function can return the
        reduced density matrix.

        Returns:
            (numpy.array, numpy.array): The one- and two-element RDMs (float64).
