    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) \\[[Peruzzo_et_al.,_2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3061),  [McClean_et_al.,_2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04279)\\] has been introduced as a hybrid quantum&ndash;classical algorithm for simulating quantum systems. Some examples of quantum simulation using VQE include solving the molecular electronic Schrödinger equation and model systems in condensed matter physics (e.g., Fermi&ndash; and Bose&ndash;Hubbard models). In this notebook, we focus on VQE within the context of solving the molecular electronic structure problem for the ground-state energy of a molecular system. The second-quantized Hamiltonian of such a system, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, assumes the following form:"

We must also apply other approximations (e.g., Trotter&ndash;Suzuki) to render it amenable for translation into a quantum circuit. The resulting qubit form of the ansatz can then be translated into a quantum circuit and, thus, able to be implemented on quantum hardware.

    "These two functions can then be used to run VQE. For simplicity, a specific optimizer from the SciPy library is used, with given hyperparameters such as tolerance or step size. Since accuracy of energy evaluation is correlated to the number of samples drawn, it is important to set it to a number large enough to guarantee that it is consistent with the optimizers convergence criteria, and to ensure the correct approximation of derivatives used by some optimizers. Setting a very large number of samples would solve this issue."
